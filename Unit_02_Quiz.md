## Section 2: Reasoning Questions

1.  Explain why using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>` is better for both SEO and accessibility compared to using generic `<div>` tags with IDs.
2.  A developer wants to create a form field for a user's birthdate. Explain why using `<input type="date">` is a better user experience than a simple `<input type="text">`.
3.  You need to embed a video on a website and ensure it works on the widest range of browsers. How would you structure your `<video>` tag to handle different video formats? Provide a code example.
4.  Describe the key difference between the HTML5 Canvas API and SVG for creating web graphics. When might you choose one over the other?
5.  Explain the roles of the `dragstart`, `dragover`, and `drop` events in a typical drag-and-drop operation.
6.  A web application needs to remember a user's preferred language and theme (light/dark mode) even after they close and reopen their browser. Which Web Storage object should be used, and why?
7.  Describe how you would create a "neon glow" effect on text using the `text-shadow` property in CSS3.
8.  What is the difference between a CSS Transition and a CSS Animation? Provide a use case where a transition is more appropriate and one where an animation is better.
9.  Explain the purpose of the `animation-iteration-count` and `animation-direction` properties in a CSS animation.
10. A developer wants to create a "flipping card" effect. Explain the roles of `perspective`, `transform-style: preserve-3d`, and `backface-visibility` in achieving this 3D effect.

## Section 3: Real-World Cases

1.  **Case: News Website Layout**
    You are structuring the HTML for a news website's homepage, which features a main top story, several other news articles, and a sidebar with weather and stock tickers. Which semantic HTML5 tags (`<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<main>`) would you use for each of these components and why?
2.  **Case: User Registration Form**
    You are building a registration form that requires a username, a strong password (at least 8 characters, with numbers and letters), and an email address. How would you use HTML5 input types and attributes (`type`, `pattern`, `required`, `placeholder`) to create a user-friendly and validated form?
3.  **Case: Website Audio Player**
    A musician wants to add a playlist to their website. They need an audio player that shows controls and provides both `.mp3` and `.ogg` versions of their songs for compatibility. Write the HTML code for a single audio player that accomplishes this.
4.  **Case: Interactive Data Chart**
    An analytics dashboard needs to display a bar chart based on real-time data received from a server. Would you use the Canvas API or SVG for this, and why?
5.  **Case: To-Do List Application**
    You are building a simple to-do list application where users can drag tasks between "Pending" and "Completed" columns. Describe the key JavaScript steps involved in handling the `drop` event to move a task element from one column to the other.
6.  **Case: Location-Based Recommendations**
    A mobile web app wants to suggest nearby coffee shops. What API would it use, and what is the most important step it must take before retrieving the user's location data?
7.  **Case: Shopping Cart Persistence**
    An e-commerce site wants to ensure that items added to a user's shopping cart remain in the cart even if the user accidentally closes the browser tab and comes back later. Which Web Storage object should be used to store the cart data?
8.  **Case: Responsive Card Design**
    A designer wants a card element to have a subtle drop shadow and slightly rounded corners. On hover, the card should lift up and grow slightly larger to indicate it's interactive. Write the CSS to achieve this effect using `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and `transition`.
9.  **Case: Loading Spinner**
    You need to create a simple loading spinner that continuously rotates. How would you define the `@keyframes` and apply the `animation` properties to achieve this effect on a `<div>` element?
10. **Case: Parallax Scrolling Effect**
    A designer wants a background image to move at a different speed than the foreground content as the user scrolls, creating a 3D-like parallax effect. Which CSS3 property could be manipulated (e.g., with JavaScript) to create this effect on the background image?

## Answers

### Section 1: Quiz Questions - Answers
1.  **1. c) `<article>`** - **Concept:** Semantic HTML. **Reason:** The `<article>` tag is specifically designed for self-contained content that could be distributed on its own, like a blog post, which fits the description perfectly.
2.  **2. It specifies that the input field must be filled out before the form can be submitted.** - **Concept:** HTML5 Form Attributes. **Reason:** The `required` attribute enables native browser validation, preventing form submission if the field is empty and improving user experience by providing immediate feedback.
3.  **3. `<video>`** - **Concept:** HTML5 Media Tags. **Reason:** The `<video>` tag is the standard HTML5 element for embedding and playing video content directly in the browser without needing plugins.
4.  **4. 2D (or '2d')** - **Concept:** Canvas API. **Reason:** To draw on a canvas, you must first get its rendering context. The `getContext('2d')` method returns the object with all the properties and methods for 2D drawing.
5.  **5. c) `dragover`** - **Concept:** Drag and Drop API. **Reason:** By default, browsers prevent dropping elements. Calling `event.preventDefault()` on the `dragover` event signals that the target element is a valid drop zone, allowing the `drop` event to fire.
6.  **6. `localStorage` data persists after the browser is closed, while `sessionStorage` data is cleared when the browser tab is closed.** - **Concept:** Web Storage. **Reason:** This difference in lifetime is the fundamental distinction, making `localStorage` suitable for long-term persistence and `sessionStorage` for temporary, session-specific data.
7.  **7. `border-radius`** - **Concept:** CSS3 Borders. **Reason:** The `border-radius` property is the standard CSS3 feature for creating rounded corners on elements.
8.  **8. `transition`** - **Concept:** CSS3 Transitions. **Reason:** The `transition` property allows for the smooth animation of CSS property changes between a start and end state over a specified duration.
9.  **9. `@keyframes`** - **Concept:** CSS3 Animations. **Reason:** The `@keyframes` at-rule is used to define the intermediate steps (or keyframes) of an animation sequence, from `0%` (from) to `100%` (to).
10. **10. `perspective` and `transform-style: preserve-3d`** - **Concept:** 3D Transformations. **Reason:** The `perspective` property gives the 3D space a sense of depth, and `transform-style: preserve-3d` ensures that child elements are positioned within that 3D space rather than being flattened.

### Section 2: Reasoning Questions - Answers
1.  **1. Explanation:** Semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>` provide clear, machine-readable meaning about the structure of the content. **Concept:** Semantic HTML Benefits. **Reason:** For SEO, search engines can better understand the layout and importance of content, improving indexing. For accessibility, screen readers can use these tags to provide better navigation and context to visually impaired users (e.g., "main navigation," "article header"). Generic `<div>` tags offer no such context.
2.  **2. Explanation:** Using `<input type="date">` is better because it instructs the browser to provide a native, user-friendly date picker interface. **Concept:** HTML5 Input Types. **Reason:** This eliminates the need for custom JavaScript date pickers, provides a consistent experience, and is more accessible, especially on mobile devices where a specialized date selection UI is shown. It also helps ensure the data format is correct.
3.  **3. Explanation:** To ensure compatibility, you should use the `<video>` tag with multiple nested `<source>` elements, each pointing to a different video format. The browser will play the first format it supports. **Concept:** HTML5 Media Tags & Compatibility. **Reason:**
    ```html
    <video controls width="640" height="360">
      <source src="my-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <source src="my-video.webm" type="video/webm">
      Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
    ```
    This structure provides MP4 as the primary choice (widest support) and WebM as a fallback for browsers that prefer open formats, ensuring maximum compatibility.
4.  **4. Explanation:** The Canvas API is a raster-based, "fire-and-forget" API where you draw pixels using JavaScript. Once drawn, the browser doesn't know what was drawn, only the resulting pixels. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a vector-based, retained-mode API that defines shapes in an XML-based DOM. **Concept:** Canvas vs. SVG. **Reason:** You would choose Canvas for dynamic applications requiring high performance and pixel-level manipulation, like games or real-time data visualization. You would choose SVG for static but scalable graphics like logos and icons, or for interactive charts where you need to attach event listeners to individual shapes.
5.  **5. Explanation:**
    -   **`dragstart`**: Fired on the draggable element when the drag begins. This is where you use `dataTransfer.setData()` to specify what data is being dragged.
    -   **`dragover`**: Fired continuously on the drop zone as a draggable element is over it. You must call `event.preventDefault()` here to allow a drop.
    -   **`drop`**: Fired on the drop zone when the element is released. This is where you use `dataTransfer.getData()` to retrieve the dragged data and perform the desired action (e.g., moving the element).
    **Concept:** Drag and Drop Event Lifecycle. **Reason:** This event sequence provides a complete hook system to manage the data, visual feedback, and final action of a drag-and-drop operation.
6.  **6. Explanation:** `localStorage` should be used. **Concept:** `localStorage` vs. `sessionStorage`. **Reason:** `localStorage` is persistent and stores data with no expiration date, meaning the data will still be available even after the browser is closed and reopened. `sessionStorage` is temporary and would be cleared once the browser tab is closed, making it unsuitable for remembering preferences across sessions.
7.  **7. Explanation:** You can create a "neon glow" effect by applying multiple, comma-separated `text-shadow` values to the text. Each subsequent shadow should have a larger blur radius and a more vibrant color. **Concept:** CSS3 Text Effects. **Reason:**
    ```css
    .neon-text {
      color: #fff;
      text-shadow: 0 0 5px #fff, 0 0 10px #fff, 0 0 20px #00aeff, 0 0 30px #00aeff;
    }
    ```
    The inner, less-blurred white shadows create a bright core, while the outer, more-blurred colored shadows create the "glow" effect.
8.  **8. Explanation:**
    -   **Transitions** are for simple state changes (e.g., from state A to state B) and are typically triggered by user interaction like `:hover`. They are not meant for complex, multi-step sequences. Use case: A button changing color on hover.
    -   **Animations** are defined with `@keyframes` and can have multiple intermediate steps (e.g., from 0% to 50% to 100%). They can run automatically on page load and loop indefinitely. Use case: A continuous loading spinner or a complex character animation.
    **Concept:** Transitions vs. Animations. **Reason:** Transitions are simpler and state-based, while animations are more powerful and timeline-based.
9.  **9. Explanation:**
    -   **`animation-iteration-count`**: Specifies the number of times the animation cycle should be played. A value of `infinite` will cause the animation to loop endlessly.
    -   **`animation-direction`**: Defines whether the animation should play forwards, backwards, or alternate between the two on each cycle (e.g., `alternate` makes the animation play from `0%` to `100%` on the first run, then `100%` to `0%` on the second).
    **Concept:** CSS Animation Properties. **Reason:** These properties provide fine-grained control over the repetition and playback flow of a `@keyframes` animation.
10. **10. Explanation:**
    -   **`perspective`**: Applied to the parent container, it creates a 3D space and defines the "distance" from the viewer to the Z=0 plane, giving child elements a sense of depth.
    -   **`transform-style: preserve-3d`**: Applied to the direct child that will be transformed (the card), it ensures that its children (front and back faces) are positioned in the 3D space, not flattened onto the card's plane.
    -   **`backface-visibility: hidden`**: Applied to the front and back faces, it makes them invisible when they are facing away from the viewer, which is essential for the "flipping" illusion.
    **Concept:** 3D Transformations. **Reason:** Together, these properties create the necessary 3D context and behavior for one element to realistically obscure another as it rotates in 3D space.

### Section 3: Real-World Cases - Answers
1.  **1. Case: News Website Layout**
    *   **Main Top Story:** `<main>` would contain the primary content of the page. The top story itself would be wrapped in an `<article>` tag, as it's a self-contained piece of content.
    *   **Other News Articles:** Each of these would also be an `<article>` tag, as they are also independent, distributable items. They might be grouped within a `<section>` tag titled "More News".
    *   **Sidebar:** The sidebar with weather and stock tickers would be wrapped in an `<aside>` tag, as its content is indirectly related to the main news content.
    **Concept:** Semantic HTML Layout. **Reason:** Using these tags correctly provides a clear, meaningful structure for screen readers and search engines to interpret the page's layout and content hierarchy.
2.  **2. Case: User Registration Form**
    *   **Username:** `<input type="text" required placeholder="Choose a username">`
    *   **Password:** `<input type="password" required pattern="(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z]).{8,}" title="Must contain at least one number, one letter, and be at least 8 characters long" placeholder="Create a password">`
    *   **Email:** `<input type="email" required placeholder="Enter your email">`
    **Concept:** HTML5 Form Validation. **Reason:** Using `type="email"` provides format validation and a specialized mobile keyboard. `type="password"` masks the input. `required` ensures no fields are left empty. `placeholder` provides user-friendly hints. The `pattern` attribute on the password field enforces strong password rules with a helpful `title` for feedback, all handled natively by the browser.
3.  **3. Case: Website Audio Player**
    *   **HTML Code:**
        ```html
        <audio controls>
          <source src="song.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
          <source src="song.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
          Your browser does not support the audio element.
        </audio>
        ```
    *   **Concept:** HTML5 Media Tags. **Reason:** The `<audio>` tag creates the player. The `controls` attribute provides the default user interface. The nested `<source>` elements provide multiple formats, allowing the browser to choose the one it supports, ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
4.  **4. Case: Interactive Data Chart**
    *   **Choice:** It depends, but **SVG** is often a better choice for interactive charts.
    *   **Concept:** Canvas vs. SVG. **Reason:** While Canvas could draw the chart and would perform well with a huge number of data points, SVG creates a DOM element for each part of the chart (each bar, line, or point). This makes it much easier to attach event listeners (like `click` or `hover` to show a tooltip) directly to individual data elements, which is a common requirement for interactive charts.
5.  **5. Case: To-Do List Application**
    *   **JavaScript Steps:**
        1.  In the `drop` event handler, first call `event.preventDefault()` to prevent any default browser action.
        2.  Use `event.dataTransfer.getData('text/plain')` to retrieve the ID of the dragged task element (which was set during the `dragstart` event).
        3.  Use `document.getElementById()` to get a reference to the actual dragged element.
        4.  Use `event.target.appendChild(draggedElement)` to append the task element to the new column (the drop zone).
    *   **Concept:** Drag and Drop API. **Reason:** This sequence correctly uses the `dataTransfer` object to pass information and manipulates the DOM to visually move the element upon a successful drop.
6.  **6. Case: Location-Based Recommendations**
    *   **API:** The **Geolocation API**.
    *   **Most Important Step:** Before retrieving the location, the application **must ask for and receive explicit user permission**. The browser handles this by showing a native prompt to the user, and the API will only succeed if the user consents.
    *   **Concept:** Geolocation API & User Privacy. **Reason:** Accessing location data is a privacy-sensitive operation, and the API is designed with a "permission-first" model to protect users.
7.  **7. Case: Shopping Cart Persistence**
    *   **Web Storage Object:** `localStorage`.
    *   **Concept:** `localStorage` vs. `sessionStorage`. **Reason:** `localStorage` should be used because its data persists even after the browser tab or window is closed. `sessionStorage` would be cleared upon closing the tab, causing the cart to be emptied, which is not the desired behavior.
8.  **8. Case: Responsive Card Design**
    *   **CSS Code:**
        ```css
        .card {
          border-radius: 8px;
          box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
          /* Define the transition for transform and box-shadow */
          transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;
        }

        .card:hover {
          transform: translateY(-5px) scale(1.02);
          box-shadow: 0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
        }
        ```
    *   **Concept:** CSS3 `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, `transform`, and `transition`. **Reason:** `border-radius` creates the rounded corners. `box-shadow` adds the initial and hovered shadow effects. `transform` handles the "lifting" (`translateY`) and "growing" (`scale`). `transition` ensures that the changes to `transform` and `box-shadow` happen smoothly over 0.3 seconds, creating a polished interactive effect.
9.  **9. Case: Loading Spinner**
    *   **CSS Code:**
        ```css
        /* Define the rotation animation */
        @keyframes spin {
          from {
            transform: rotate(0deg);
          }
          to {
            transform: rotate(360deg);
          }
        }

        .spinner {
          width: 50px;
          height: 50px;
          border: 5px solid #f3f3f3; /* Light grey track */
          border-top: 5px solid #3498db; /* Blue spinner */
          border-radius: 50%;
          /* Apply the animation */
          animation: spin 1s linear infinite;
        }
        ```
    *   **Concept:** CSS Animations & `@keyframes`. **Reason:** The `@keyframes` rule named `spin` defines a full 360-degree rotation. The `animation` property applies this `spin` animation to the `.spinner` element, making it last 1 second, proceed at a constant speed (`linear`), and loop `infinite`-ly.
10. **10. Case: Parallax Scrolling Effect**
    *   **CSS Property:** The `transform` property, specifically `translateY()`.
    *   **Concept:** CSS Transformations & JavaScript. **Reason:** As the user scrolls, JavaScript can be used to listen to the scroll event. Inside the event handler, you can calculate a new, slower `translateY` value for the background image based on the page's scroll position. Applying this `transform: translateY(...)` to the background image will make it appear to move more slowly than the foreground content, creating the parallax depth effect. Using `transform` is more performant for this than manipulating properties like `background-position`.

### Section 5: All Possible 2-Mark Remember Questions - Answers
1.  **1. What is HTML5?** - **Concept:** HTML5 Definition. **Reason:** HTML5 is the fifth and latest version of the HyperText Markup Language, designed to deliver rich content and interactive web applications natively in the browser without requiring external plugins.
2.  **2. List two key design principles of HTML5.** - **Concept:** HTML5 Principles. **Reason:** 1) Backward compatibility ("Don't break the web"). 2) Standardizing common developer practices ("Pave the cowpaths").
3.  **3. Name two new features introduced in HTML5.** - **Concept:** HTML5 Features. **Reason:** Native multimedia support with `<audio>` and `<video>` tags, and new semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<article>`.
4.  **4. What is the purpose of the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration?** - **Concept:** HTML5 Doctype. **Reason:** It is the document type declaration that tells the browser that the page is written in HTML5. Its simplicity is a feature of the HTML5 standard.
5.  **5. What is semantic HTML?** - **Concept:** Semantic HTML Definition. **Reason:** Semantic HTML uses markup to convey the meaning and purpose of content, rather than just its visual presentation, improving accessibility and machine readability.

7.  **7. Differentiate between `<article>` and `<section>` tags.** - **Concept:** Semantic Elements. **Reason:** An `<article>` represents a self-contained, independently distributable piece of content (like a blog post), while a `<section>` is a generic standalone section of a document, typically with a heading, that doesn't have a more specific semantic element.
8.  **8. Which HTML5 tag is used for major navigation blocks?** - **Concept:** Semantic Elements. **Reason:** The `<nav>` tag.
9.  **9. Name two new HTML5 input types that enhance user experience.** - **Concept:** HTML5 Forms. **Reason:** `email` (provides email format validation and specialized mobile keyboard) and `date` (provides a native date picker).
10. **10. What is the purpose of the `placeholder` attribute?** - **Concept:** Form Attributes. **Reason:** It provides a hint to the user about the expected input value, displayed inside the input field before the user types.
11. **11. How does the `required` attribute improve form validation?** - **Concept:** Form Validation. **Reason:** It specifies that an input field must be filled out before the form can be submitted, with the browser providing native validation.
12. **12. Explain the benefit of using `type="number"` over `type="text"` for numeric input.** - **Concept:** Form Input Types. **Reason:** `type="number"` provides automatic validation for numeric input, allows `min`/`max`/`step` attributes, and often offers a specialized UI (spinners, numeric keypad on mobile).
13. **13. Why were HTML5 `<audio>` and `<video>` tags introduced, replacing the need for plugins?** - **Concept:** Native Media. **Reason:** They provide a standardized, native way to embed multimedia, addressing issues like security vulnerabilities, performance, accessibility, and compatibility associated with third-party plugins like Flash.
14. **14. List two common attributes for both `<audio>` and `<video>` tags.** - **Concept:** Media Attributes. **Reason:** `src`, `controls`, `autoplay`, `loop`, `muted`, `preload` (any two).
15. **15. What is the purpose of the `<source>` element within `<audio>` or `<video>`?** - **Concept:** Media Compatibility. **Reason:** It allows developers to specify multiple media files in different formats, enabling the browser to choose the first format it supports, ensuring broader compatibility.
16. **16. How does the `<track>` element contribute to media accessibility?** - **Concept:** Media Accessibility. **Reason:** It allows for the inclusion of timed text tracks like captions, subtitles, and descriptions, making multimedia content accessible to users with hearing or visual impairments.
17. **17. What is the purpose of the HTML5 `<canvas>` element?** - **Concept:** Canvas API. **Reason:** The `<canvas>` element provides a container or "drawing surface" in an HTML document. All drawing on it is done programmatically using JavaScript via the Canvas API.
18. **18. Which JavaScript method is used to get the drawing context of a canvas?** - **Concept:** Canvas API. **Reason:** The `getContext()` method, typically called with the argument `'2d'` to get the 2D rendering context (e.g., `canvas.getContext('2d')`).
19. **19. Name two methods for drawing rectangles on a 2D canvas context.** - **Concept:** Canvas Drawing. **Reason:** `fillRect(x, y, width, height)` for drawing a filled rectangle, and `strokeRect(x, y, width, height)` for drawing a rectangular outline.
20. **20. What is the first step to drawing a custom shape (like a line or triangle) using canvas paths?** - **Concept:** Canvas Paths. **Reason:** The first step is to call the `beginPath()` method to start a new path.
21. **21. Which HTML attribute is required to make an element draggable?** - **Concept:** Drag and Drop API. **Reason:** The `draggable="true"` attribute.
22. **22. In the Drag and Drop API, why is it necessary to call `event.preventDefault()` in the `dragover` event handler?** - **Concept:** Drag and Drop API. **Reason:** By default, browsers prevent dropping elements onto most HTML elements. Calling `event.preventDefault()` in the `dragover` handler signals to the browser that the element is a valid drop target, thus allowing the `drop` event to fire.
23. **23. What is the purpose of the `dataTransfer` object?** - **Concept:** Drag and Drop API. **Reason:** The `dataTransfer` object is used to hold the data being transferred during a drag-and-drop operation. It is set during the `dragstart` event and read during the `drop` event.
24. **24. Which event is fired on the draggable element when the user starts dragging it?** - **Concept:** Drag and Drop Events. **Reason:** The `dragstart` event.
25. **25. What is the primary purpose of the HTML5 Geolocation API?** - **Concept:** Geolocation API. **Reason:** The Geolocation API provides a standard way for web applications to access a user's geographical location, with their explicit permission.
26. **26. Why is user permission a critical aspect of the Geolocation API?** - **Concept:** Geolocation Privacy. **Reason:** Accessing a user's location is a significant privacy concern. Requiring explicit permission ensures that users have control over their private data and protects them from unauthorized tracking.
27. **27. Which JavaScript object is the entry point for the Geolocation API?** - **Concept:** Geolocation API. **Reason:** The `navigator.geolocation` object.
28. **28. Differentiate between `getCurrentPosition()` and `watchPosition()`.** - **Concept:** Geolocation Methods. **Reason:** `getCurrentPosition()` retrieves the user's location once, while `watchPosition()` continuously monitors the user's location and reports updates as the position changes.
29. **29. List two advantages of Web Storage over cookies.** - **Concept:** Web Storage vs. Cookies. **Reason:** Web Storage offers a larger storage capacity (5-10MB vs. 4KB) and the data is not sent with every HTTP request, reducing network overhead.
30. **30. What is the main difference between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`?** - **Concept:** Web Storage Types. **Reason:** Data in `localStorage` persists even after the browser is closed, while data in `sessionStorage` is temporary and is cleared when the browser tab is closed.
31. **31. Which method is used to store a key-value pair in Web Storage?** - **Concept:** Web Storage API. **Reason:** The `setItem(key, value)` method.
32. **32. How would you store a JavaScript object in `localStorage`?** - **Concept:** Web Storage API. **Reason:** You must first convert the object into a JSON string using `JSON.stringify()` before storing it with `setItem()`.
33. **33. What is the main difference in specification between CSS3 and its predecessors?** - **Concept:** CSS3 Modularity. **Reason:** CSS3 is modular, meaning it is split into separate modules (e.g., Selectors, Backgrounds and Borders) that are developed and standardized independently, unlike the single, monolithic specifications of earlier versions.
34. **34. What is the purpose of the `border-radius` property in CSS3?** - **Concept:** CSS3 Borders. **Reason:** The `border-radius` property is used to create rounded corners on an element's box, a task that previously required images or complex workarounds.
35. **35. What are vendor prefixes in CSS?** - **Concept:** CSS Vendor Prefixes. **Reason:** Vendor prefixes (e.g., `-webkit-`, `-moz-`) are used by browser makers to implement experimental or non-standard CSS features, allowing developers to test them before they are finalized.
36. **36. What is the role of Media Queries in modern web design?** - **Concept:** Responsive Design. **Reason:** Media Queries are the foundation of Responsive Web Design (RWD), allowing developers to apply different CSS styles based on device characteristics like viewport width, enabling a single website to adapt to different screen sizes.
37. **37. What is the purpose of the `background-size: cover;` declaration?** - **Concept:** CSS3 Backgrounds. **Reason:** It scales the background image to be as large as possible to completely cover the container, even if it means cropping the image.
38. **38. How can you apply multiple background images to a single element in CSS3?** - **Concept:** CSS3 Backgrounds. **Reason:** By providing a comma-separated list of URLs in the `background-image` property, along with corresponding comma-separated values for other background properties.
39. **39. What does the `text-shadow` property do?** - **Concept:** CSS3 Text Effects. **Reason:** It adds a shadow effect to text, which can be configured with horizontal and vertical offsets, a blur radius, and a color.
40. **40. Which CSS property is used to display an ellipsis (...) for overflowing text?** - **Concept:** CSS3 Text Effects. **Reason:** The `text-overflow: ellipsis;` property, used in conjunction with `overflow: hidden;` and `white-space: nowrap;`.
41. **41. What is the purpose of the CSS `transform` property?** - **Concept:** CSS3 Transformations. **Reason:** The `transform` property allows you to modify the coordinate space of an element to move, rotate, scale, or skew it without affecting the layout of surrounding elements.
42. **42. Name two 2D transformation functions.** - **Concept:** 2D Transforms. **Reason:** `translate()`, `rotate()`, `scale()`, `skew()` (any two).
43. **43. What is the role of the `perspective` property in 3D transformations?** - **Concept:** 3D Transforms. **Reason:** The `perspective` property is applied to a parent container to give its child elements a sense of depth and distance in 3D space.
44. **44. Does applying a `transform` to an element affect the position of other elements in the document flow?** - **Concept:** Transform & Document Flow. **Reason:** No, transformations do not affect the document flow. The space taken up by the element remains the same, and other elements are not pushed around.
4unitt. **45. What is the purpose of CSS Transitions?** - **Concept:** CSS3 Transitions. **Reason:** CSS Transitions allow property changes in CSS to occur smoothly over a specified duration, rather than happening instantly, which is used to create simple animations and effects.
46. **46. What are the two required properties when defining a transition?** - **Concept:** Transition Properties. **Reason:** `transition-property` (which property to animate) and `transition-duration` (how long the animation should take).
47. **47. What does the `transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;` do?** - **Concept:** Transition Timing. **Reason:** It specifies that the transition will start slowly, speed up in the middle, and then end slowly, creating a more natural-feeling motion.
48. **48. How do you apply a transition effect to all changeable properties of an element?** - **Concept:** Transition Properties. **Reason:** By using the value `all` for the `transition-property` (e.g., `transition: all 0.5s ease;`).
49. **49. What is the purpose of the `@keyframes` rule in CSS3?** - **Concept:** CSS3 Animations. **Reason:** The `@keyframes` rule is used to define the stages and styles of a CSS animation, allowing for multi-step sequences by specifying styles at different points in the animation's timeline.
50. **50. How do you make a CSS animation loop indefinitely?** - **Concept:** Animation Properties. **Reason:** By setting the `animation-iteration-count` property to `infinite`.
51. **51. What is the difference between CSS Transitions and CSS Animations?** - **Concept:** Transitions vs. Animations. **Reason:** Transitions are for simple state changes (start to end) and are typically triggered by user interaction. Animations are for complex, multi-step sequences defined with `@keyframes` and can run and loop automatically.
52. **52. What does `animation-fill-mode: forwards;` do?** - **Concept:** Animation Properties. **Reason:** It specifies that the element will retain the styles defined in the final keyframe (`100%` or `to`) after the animation has finished playing.
