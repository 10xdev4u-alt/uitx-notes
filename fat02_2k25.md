Macha, here is the formatted Markdown for **FAT02**! This one focuses heavily on CSS styling and JavaScript logic. I've organized it so your LLM can easily generate the code snippets required.

## PART A (10 x 2 = 20 Marks)

**1.** Compare inline CSS and external CSS in terms of maintainability with an example.

**2.** Write the CSS code to give a heading (`<h1>`) a black shadow with 5px horizontal and 3px vertical offset.

**3.** Sketch the CSS box model.

**4.** Apply two box-shadows on a `<div>`: the first shadow should be 10px right, 5px down, 15px blur, gray color, and the second shadow should be 5px left, 8px up, 10px blur, semi-transparent black color appearing inside the `<div>`.

**5.** Write a CSS rule using border-image to apply `border.png` around an image with 30 slice value.

**6.** Enlist the features of JavaScript.

**7.** Differentiate Let and Var declaration in JavaScript.

**8.** Write a JS function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.

**9.** Given an object `car = { brand: "Toyota", speed: 120}`, add a method `accelerate()` that increases speed by 10 and returns the new speed.

**10.** Create an array of 6 random numbers between 1 and 50, sort them in descending order, and display the largest number using the Math object.

## PART B (3 x 10 = 30 Marks)

**11. (a)** Explain various types of CSS selectors with examples. How can combining multiple selectors improve the maintainability and specificity of a stylesheet in large-scale web development projects?
**(OR)**
**11. (b)** Discuss the key features of CSS that make it essential in modern web design. How do these features enhance performance, design consistency, and user experience across web pages?

**12. (a)** Illustrate the ways in which CSS background and text effect properties are combined to improve the design and readability of a webpage? Support your answer with examples of at least five CSS properties.
**(OR)**
**12. (b)** Create a CSS animation for a website button that smoothly changes its background color from blue to green and back repeatedly when hovered over. Describe the CSS properties and keyframes used, and provide the code for the animation.

**13. (a)** Write a JavaScript function named `filterAndTransform` that takes two arguments: an array of numbers and a callback function. The function should filter out all numbers from the array that do not satisfy a condition defined in the callback function and return a new array where the remaining numbers are doubled.
**(OR)**
**13. (b)** Elaborate how the Document Object Model (DOM) facilitates dynamic interaction between JavaScript and HTML elements.
